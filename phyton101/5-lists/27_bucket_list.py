#Chapter Recap
# Lists: used to store multiple items in a single variable
# Index: item’s position in list (0-indexed; starts at 0)
# Slicing: list[start:end] returns items start (inclusive) to end (exclusive)
# Built-in functions: min(), max(), sum(), len()
# Lists have many built-in methods: append(), clear(), copy(), count(), extend(), index(), insert(), pop(), remove(), reverse(), sort()
# Iteration: for-in loop, range() and len()
