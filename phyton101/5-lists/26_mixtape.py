#Mixtape

#For-in loop: 
#For-in loops are used to iterate over a sequence (like a list, tuple, or string) in Python.

#Example:
#snowfall = [0.3, 0.0, 0.0, 1.2, 3.9, 2.2, 0.8]
#for i in snowfall:
#  print(i)
#  # Output: 0.3, 0.0, 0.0, 1.2, 3.9, 2.2, 0.8

#For-in with range() and len():
#The range() function generates a sequence of numbers, which can be used to iterate over with a for loop.
#The len() function returns the number of items in an object, such as a list or string.
#Example:
#snowfall = [0.3, 0.0, 0.0, 1.2, 3.9, 2.2, 0.8]
#for i in range(len(snowfall)):
#  print(snowfall[i])
#  # Output: 0.3, 0.0, 0.0, 1.2, 3.9, 2.2, 0.8
