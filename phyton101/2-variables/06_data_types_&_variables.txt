06. Data Types & Variables
================================================================

Welcome to your introduction to variablesâ€”a place where you 
can let your code dance and your data sing! This guide explores 
the magic behind storing information in variables. Let's get 
excited about coding, one variable at a time! ðŸŒŸ

----------------------------------------------------------------
Variables
----------------------------------------------------------------
In programming, variables are used for storing data values. 
Each variable has a name and holds a value. ðŸ“¦

The variable name can consist of letters, numbers, and the 
_ underscore.

Here are some valid examples of variable assignments:

    name = 'Erlich Bachman'
    user_id = 16180339887
    progress = 0.75
    exp = 60
    verified = True

The "=" sign means assignment. It assigns a value to a variable 
name. For example:

    - We're assigning the string value 'Erlich Bachman' to the 
      variable "name".
      
    - We're assigning the number value 16180339887 to the 
      variable "user_id".
      
    - We're assigning the number value 0.75 to the variable 
      "progress".
      
    - We're assigning the number value 60 to the variable "exp".
      
    - We're assigning the truth value True to the variable 
      "verified".

We can also change the value of a variable or print it out:

    xp = 70
    xp = 80

    print(xp)    # Output: 80

In this example, we first assign 70 to "xp", then reassign it to 80, 
and finally print the updated value.

----------------------------------------------------------------
Data Types
----------------------------------------------------------------
Data in programming comes in different flavors. Let's explore them:

1. Integer (int)
----------------
An integer is a whole number with no decimal point. It is used 
for countable values (like the number of people on a bus or the 
number of jellybeans in a jar).

Example:
    year = 2023
    age = 32

2. Float (float)
----------------
A float is a decimal number used for precise measurements, 
fractions, or percentages.

Example:
    pi = 3.14159
    meal_cost = 12.99

3. String (str)
----------------
A string is used for storing text. It is wrapped in double 
quotes " " or single quotes ' '.

Example:
    message = "good nite"
    username = '@snoopdogg'

4. Boolean (bool)
----------------
A Boolean value represents truthiness and can only be either 
True or False. It is named after the British mathematician 
George Boole (1815-1864).

Example:
    late_to_class = False
    cranky = True

Keep on Coding!
----------------------------------------------------------------
Embrace these concepts as your stepping stones on your coding 
journey. Experiment, change, and enjoy every line of code you 
write. Remember, coding isnâ€™t just about logicâ€”it's an art. Let 
your creativity flow, and keep pushing forward on your learning 
adventure. Enjoy every step along the way! ðŸš€
