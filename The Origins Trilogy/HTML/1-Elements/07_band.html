    <h3>About</h3>
    <p>Melancholy California sunsets turned into sound — that is the arrow-straight vibe <a href="https://thenbhd.com/">The Neighbourhood</a> has been shooting since 2011.<br>
        Fusing alternative rock with shadowy R&B textures, their grayscale aesthetic and slow-burn hooks (“Sweater Weather,” anyone?) made<br>
        them Tumblr-legendary and Billboard-relevant all at once. The band is currently on hiatus, while front-man Jesse Rutherford pursues<br>
        solo adventures, but their catalog still feels like late-night neon. </p>
