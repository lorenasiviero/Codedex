          <h3>Meet Lorena (me!)üåä</h3>
          <p>I‚Äôm Lorena Siviero‚Äîpolyglot vibe-seeker (Portugu√™s, English, Italiano, –†—É—Å—Å–∫–∏–π) who swaps study sessions for surf breaks the moment the swell hits.</p>
          <p>Cat-mom to the twin mischief-makers Mal√©vola & Cruella, I let their playful chaos soundtrack my days. </p>
          <p>Off the board and beyond the cat tower, I‚Äôm deep in late-night chats with my friends, trading favorite artists from Tame Impala moods to Stephen King musings, always chasing the next lyrical spark.</p>

          <h3>Vladivostok üá∑üá∫</h3>
          <p>I lived in Vladivostok, Russia, for three years while completing pre-clinical medical studies.</p>
          <p>Navigating a new language, climate, and academic culture strengthened my resilience and cross-cultural communication skills.</p>

          <h3>From Pixels to Photography üì∏</h3>
          <p>The narrative depth of the game <em>Life Is Strange</em> sparked a passion for visual storytelling that led me to purchase my first Nikon camera</p>
          <p>I began documenting everyday scenes with a cinematic perspective, refining my understanding of composition and light.</p>
          <p>Although my shutter has been quieter lately, photography remains a creative discipline I‚Äôm determined to reignite with fresh focus.</p>
